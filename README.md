## Framing the Problem

### Problem Identification

Exploring about the prediction on the winning or losing result of the game is our focusing point for this project. We would like to form a model that input the relavent data and return the result of that game. We are building a classifier with a binary classification. 

Our response variable is the result of that game. It will be a binary result which 1 equals to win and 0 equals to lose. The reason why we choose it is because inside League of Legends, no matter what resources they receive in the game, the result of the game should be the most important thing for either players and audiences. In addition, the result of each game is the hardest to predict just by watching the game untill the game actually ends (one team destorys the opposing Nexus), and thus we choose it as our response variable. 

In order to explore our prediction problem, we perform the same data cleaning steps as we do in project3: Investigation-on-League-of-Legends. We still keeping all the team rows inside the dataframe, and we strip all the rows for specific player, but we also include some new data cleaning.
